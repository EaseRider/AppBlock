# AppBlock
App to block certain apps from beeing installed

## Idea
Some apps should be prevented from beeing installed. This could desirable for security reasons or to prevent installation of unwanted apps.

## Technical solutions
* It should be possible to install an empty *placeholder App* with the same bundle name of the blocked app.
  * Simple to setup
  * Might be problematic due to permissions
  * Uninstalling the app leads to remaining apps
* is there another way to accomplish this?
